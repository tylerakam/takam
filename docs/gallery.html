                <figcaption>Most of my works are in the form of YouTube videos, found on my personal YouTube channel, Takamator, and on the Chiefofbricks channel, where I work with fellow filmmakers and friends to make short films and projects. A majority of my focus goes to content on the Chiefofbricks channel, while the content on Takamator serves as a way to categorize school and solo projects.
                    
                    The projects made on Chiefofbricks are a team effort, and my skills are utilized differently each time. Some videos are directed, edited, or conceived by me, but each video does have my own creative input if my name is credited in any way.
